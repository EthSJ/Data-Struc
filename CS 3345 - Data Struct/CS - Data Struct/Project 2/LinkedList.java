Project 2
This is the very genericy linked list. It'll have magazine get plugged into it.
Set up to go Linked List ---contains an object--> Node --Contains an object --> magazine
This means Linked list works with nodes ONLY. Nodes work with magazines (or other) ONLY!
Linked List CANNOT work with magazines (or other)
